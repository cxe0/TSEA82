# Lab 4: Dot Collection Game

This lab features a dot collection game where the player controls a dot and is tasked with moving it to randomly placed dots on the screen. The player must use a joystick to maneuver their dot to the target dot and pick it up. Once collected, a victory beep is emitted, and the target dot is randomly placed again for the player to collect.

## Description

The game utilizes a microcontroller to manage the player's movement, the placement of target dots, and the collection mechanism. The player's dot is controlled using a joystick, which adjusts the dot's position on the screen. The game continuously runs, updating the display and checking for dot collection events.

## How to Play

1. Use the joystick to control the movement of your dot.
2. Maneuver your dot to the target dot displayed on the screen.
3. When your dot overlaps with the target dot, it will be collected.
4. Upon successful collection, a victory beep will sound, and a new target dot will be randomly placed on the screen.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 to continue playing the game.
