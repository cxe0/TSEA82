# Lab 2: Morse Code Transmitter

This lab focuses on implementing a Morse code transmitter capable of encoding sentences or words into Morse code. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. 

## Description

The code encodes a predefined text string into Morse code and generates corresponding signals to represent each character. The Morse code signals are then outputted, typically as sound or light signals.

## How to Use

1. Ensure the microcontroller is properly connected to the output device (e.g., speaker or LED).
2. Upload the provided assembly code to the microcontroller.
3. Power on the system.
4. The Morse code signals representing the predefined text string will be transmitted.

## Credits

This lab was developed as part of the TSEA82 course curriculum.
