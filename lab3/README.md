# Lab 3: Digital Clock for Time Display

This lab focuses on implementing a digital clock capable of displaying time up to an hour. The clock utilizes a microcontroller to manage the timekeeping and display functions.

## Description

The program establishes a digital clock system that displays time up to an hour. The clock utilizes a 7-segment display to represent the time in a human-readable format. The time is stored in Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format, allowing for easy conversion and display.

## How to Use

1. Ensure the microcontroller is properly connected to the 7-segment display and any necessary input devices.
2. Upload the provided assembly code to the microcontroller.
3. Power on the system.
4. The clock will initialize and start displaying the current time. The display will update in real-time as the time advances.
