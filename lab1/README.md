# Lab 1: IR Decoder

This lab focuses on implementing an IR decoder for decoding signals received from a keyboard. In embedded systems, communication with the external world is crucial, whether it's reading a digital signal or transmitting bytes or ASCII characters. This decoder handles various methods of communication, including serial and parallel transmission.

## Description

It is designed to read an IR signal coming from a keyboard and convert it into its original value. The processed signal is then displayed on a seven-segment display with a built-in BCD to seven-segment decoder.

## How to Use

1. Ensure the microcontroller is properly connected to the keyboard and seven-segment display.
2. Upload the provided assembly code to the microcontroller.
3. Power on the system.
4. Press the start button on the keyboard to initiate the decoding process.
5. The decoded output will be displayed on the seven-segment display.
